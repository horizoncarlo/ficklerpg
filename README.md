# Fickle RPG - Dice Roller
Fickle RPG is a pen-and-paper roleplaying and cooperative storytelling game, distinguished by the core dice resolution mechanic which has bluffing, bidding, and meaningful decisions.

With Covid-19 I've been running a lot of remote, online sessions of the game. I realized a lot of my friends don't have six-sided dice lying around their house. So I figured I'd put together a simple dice roller to help.

You can see the rules of the game and lots more info at: https://horizongamesblog.wordpress.com/fickle-rpg/
